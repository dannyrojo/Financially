Money can't buy me love, but it might help me pay off my student loans!

Title: Financially

Description: It's the first of the month and you just got paid.  After taxes, bills, and feeding yourself, you have a couple bucks left over. Where should I put that money?  Buy some skiis, pay down the principal on my loan, throw into an annuity, or throw it into the markets? My goal for this program is to visualize various aspects of my finances to gain insights into which parts of my portfolio will pay it's divideds.

Update Log:

4/13/23: Created a basic GUI for the app and some basic source code for financial calculations.  Also included a timer debugger in the event handler to keep track of memory.  Achievements Unlocked:  Signals and Slots functions in Qt, how to make a timer debugger, wrestling with and understanding the limitations of makefile, and how to use CMake.   Next steps and considerations:  Creating buttons, connecting mathematical operations, consider memory management and leaks.

4/13/23 Part Two:  Added a button to calculate NetPay, as well as began scaffolding for more complex, encapsulated code for the future.   Acheivements unlcocked:  Learned about &lambda functions and how to use them as a bridge between Qt slots and regular functions.  Familiarized myself with Qt6's parent-child relationships and how I can manage memory more efficiently. Next steps and considerations:  Flesh out my basic calculator,  add another calculator in a separate view, work on memory management a little more, and consider possibly implementing a basic API or URL checker for tax data, or work on using SQL to build a small database for data storage.
